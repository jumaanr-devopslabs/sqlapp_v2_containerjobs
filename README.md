# Azure Pipeline YAML Explanation

This Azure Pipeline YAML file defines a CI/CD process for building and deploying a Docker image to Azure Container Registry (ACR). Below is a breakdown of the key components:

---

#### **Pipeline Triggers**
- `trigger: - main`: The pipeline is triggered whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

#### **Resources**
- `resources: - repo: self`: Indicates that the pipeline is using the current repository as its source.

#### **Variables**
- `dockerRegistryServiceConnection`: The ID of the service connection used to authenticate with ACR.
- `imageRepository`: The name of the Docker image repository (`sqlappdocker`).
- `containerRegistry`: The name of the ACR (`azcrazdevopseastus.azurecr.io`).
- `dockerfilePath`: The path to the Dockerfile (`$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/sqlapp/Dockerfile`).
- `tag`: The Docker image tag, which is set to the build ID (`$(Build.BuildId)`).
- `group`: References a variable group called `dockervariablegroup`.
- `vmImageName`: Specifies the agent VM image used for the build, in this case, `ubuntu-latest`.

---

### **Stages**

#### 1. **Build Stage**
- **Display Name**: "Build and push stage"
- **Job**: `Build`
  - Uses the `ubuntu-latest` VM image.
  - Runs the job inside a container (`mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0`).
  
  **Steps:**
  - **UseDotNet@2**: Installs the .NET SDK (`version: '6.x'`).
  - **DotNetCoreCLI@2**: Builds the .NET project (`command: build`) using all `.csproj` files.
  - **DotNetCoreCLI@2**: Publishes the build output to the release directory (`command: publish`).
  - **Publish Artifact**: Publishes the build artifacts (`artifact: buildartifacts`) for use in the next stage.

#### 2. **Deploy Stage**
- **Display Name**: "Push Stage"
- **Job**: `Deploy`
  - Uses the `ubuntu-latest` VM image.

  **Steps:**
  - **Download**: Downloads the build artifacts from the previous stage (`artifact: buildartifacts`).
  - **Docker@2**: Builds and pushes the Docker image to ACR. This step performs both the build and push operations.
    - `buildContext`: Context directory for the Docker build (`$(Pipeline.Workspace)/buildartifacts/sqlapp`).
    - `repository`: Docker repository name (`$(imageRepository)`).
    - `dockerfile`: Path to the Dockerfile (`$(dockerfilePath)`).
    - `containerRegistry`: The service connection for ACR authentication (`$(dockerRegistryServiceConnection)`).
    - `tags`: Specifies the tags for the image, including the build ID and `latest`.

---

### **Summary**
This pipeline automates the process of building a .NET application, creating a Docker image, and pushing it to Azure Container Registry. The build stage compiles the application, and the deploy stage pushes the resulting Docker image to ACR. This setup allows for continuous integration and continuous deployment of the application.
